# Spotify Recommender Systems Master's Research Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Master's research project on Spotify and how its recommender systems work. This project delves into the intricate world of music recommendation algorithms, focusing specifically on Spotify's platform. 

## Overview

In the era of digital streaming, platforms like Spotify play a crucial role in shaping users' music consumption experiences. Recommender systems are at the heart of these platforms, providing personalized recommendations to millions of users worldwide. Our research aims to enhance the understanding and effectiveness of Spotify's recommender systems.

## Objectives

- Analyse different recommendation algorithms and methodologies.
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.
- Propose novel techniques or modifications to enhance recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. This is going to specifically incorporate user's own classification and mood-based listening. Furthermore, how album artwork can influence listening will be explored. 
- Evaluate the performance of these techniques.

## Methodology

1. **Finding Data**: Different methods will be explored for how data can be acquired. Such as using the Spotify API and using Last.fm data etc. 
2. **Algorithm Analysis**: Current recommendation algorithms on Spotify will be researched, examining their underlying principles and feature engineering techniques.
3. **Enhancement Proposal**: Based on our analysis, I will propose enhancements to the existing algorithms.
4. **Implementation**: Implementing the proposed changed and novel techniques.
5. **Evaluation**: How well does the recommender actually do?
